# Bruce-edit rule store

Editing practices induced from Bruce's own edits to `Chapters/`, written by
`/bruce-edit-capture` and consumed by `/bruce-edit-apply`. Two skills share
this one file: `.claude/skills/bruce-edit-capture/SKILL.md` mines a diff and
proposes entries, `.claude/skills/bruce-edit-apply/SKILL.md` applies the
promoted ones to a chapter or to the book.

**This file is a workbench, not a fourth style guide.** The permanent homes
for style rules are the global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` watch list, the
`activate` skill's "Accrued patterns", and the `deep-review` skill's accrued
notes. A rule that proves out gets filed into whichever of those fits, and its
entry here records where it went in a `Home` field. The entry stays here
afterward anyway, because being in a style guide is not the same as having
been applied to 47 existing chapters, and only this file drives that sweep.

**Promotion.** One sighting makes a candidate. A second independent sighting,
in a different chapter, promotes it to a rule. Only rules are applied.

**Retirement is permanent.** A rule or candidate Bruce rejects moves to
Retired with his reason and is never proposed again, in any wording. Without
that record, every capture round re-proposes the same rejected rule.

---

## Entry format

Both Rules and Candidates use this shape. Rules are numbered `R1, R2, ...`
and candidates `C1, C2, ...`; a promoted candidate keeps its sightings and
takes the next free `R` number.

```
### R1. Short imperative statement of the rule

**Test.** How to decide whether the rule fires at a given site. A rule with
no usable test cannot be applied and should stay a candidate.

**Keep when.** The exception, if the evidence shows one. "None seen yet" is
an honest value here and marks the rule as needing care during a sweep.

**Sightings.** 2
- `22_Chapter` 2026-08-15, was Claude-written:
  "the count would be wrong again" -> "the count would still be wrong"
- `31_Chapter` 2026-08-20, was Bruce-written:
  "..." -> "..."

**Home.** activate (Accrued patterns) | CLAUDE.md watch list | deep-review |
this file only
```

The verbatim before/after pairs are the point of the entry, not decoration.
When a rule later looks wrong, re-read its sightings rather than arguing from
its wording; the wording is my summary, the pairs are the evidence.

A rule that adds something is worth more than a rule that cuts something, and
is rarer in a diff. Mark additive rules so a sweep can weight them: a store
made entirely of cut-this-word rules will sand the voice off the book.

## Rules

Promoted, two or more sightings, applied by `/bruce-edit-apply`.

### R1. Give "raises" an object

**Test.** The verb "raise"/"raises"/"raising" with no object after it:
end of sentence, a comma, or an adverb/conjunction ("raises instead",
"returns or raises"). Supply the exception's name where the text knows
it, otherwise "an exception".

**Keep when.** The object is fronted in a relative clause ("the exception
it raises", "whatever `slope()` raises", "what it re-raises"). Code and
`#:` markers are never touched.

**Sightings.** 2 (additive)
- `25_Template_Method` 2026-08-29, was Claude-written:
  "The `class Typo` statement raises instead of finishing" ->
  "The `class Typo` statement raises a `TypeError` instead of finishing"
- `Solutions/14_Decorators`, `Solutions/25_Template_Method`,
  `Solutions/47_Stateless_in_Practice` 2026-08-29, found by sweep after
  Bruce named the rule: "returns or raises." -> "returns or raises an
  exception."; "this one raises instead" -> "this one raises an exception
  instead"; "returns rather than raises" -> "returns a value rather than
  raising an exception"

**Home.** CLAUDE.md watch list (global, Writing Style) and activate
(Accrued patterns). Bruce reported the rule as one that "has been lost";
no prior record of it existed anywhere in the repo, the skills, or memory.

## Candidates

One sighting each. Logged, not applied. A second sighting in a different
chapter promotes one; several capture rounds with no second sighting mean it
was a one-off, and it can be retired at Bruce's call.

*(none yet)*

---

## Retired

Rejected by Bruce, or promoted and later withdrawn. Never propose these
again. Record the reason: a bare "rejected" tells a future round nothing and
invites a reworded re-proposal.
