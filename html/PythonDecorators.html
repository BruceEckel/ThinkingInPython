<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">This chapter is a work in progress; it&#8217;s probably better if you don&#8217;t
begin making changes until I&#8217;ve finished the original version, which
is being posted as a series on my weblog.</p>
</div>
<p>This amazing feature appeared in the language almost apologetically and with
concern that it might not be that useful.</p>
<p>I predict that in time it will be seen as one of the more powerful features in
the language. The problem is that all the introductions to decorators that I
have seen have been rather confusing, so I will try to rectify that here.</p>
<div class="section" id="decorators-vs-the-decorator-pattern">
<h2>Decorators vs. the Decorator Pattern<a class="headerlink" href="#decorators-vs-the-decorator-pattern" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First, you need to understand that the word &#8220;decorator&#8221; was used with some
trepidation in Python, because there was concern that it would be completely
confused with the <em>Decorator</em> pattern from the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201633612/ref=ase_bruceeckelA/">Design Patterns book</a>. At one
point other terms were considered for the feature, but &#8220;decorator&#8221; seems to be
the one that sticks.</p>
<p>Indeed, you can use Python decorators to implement the <em>Decorator</em> pattern, but
that&#8217;s an extremely limited use of it. Python decorators, I think, are best
equated to macros.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="history-of-macros">
<h2>History of Macros<a class="headerlink" href="#history-of-macros" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The macro has a long history, but most people will probably have had experience
with C preprocessor macros. The problems with C macros were (1) they were in a
different language (not C) and (2) the behavior was sometimes bizarre, and often
inconsistent with the behavior of the rest of C.</p>
<p>Both Java and C# have added <em>annotations</em>, which allow you to do some things to
elements of the language. Both of these have the problems that (1) to do what
you want, you sometimes have to jump through some enormous and untenable hoops,
which follows from (2) these annotation features have their hands tied by the
bondage-and-discipline (or as <a class="reference external" href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SoftwareDevelopmentAttitude.html">Martin Fowler gently puts it: &#8220;Directing&#8221;</a>) nature of
those languages.</p>
<p>In a slightly different vein, many C++ programmers (myself included) have noted
the generative abilities of C++ templates and have used that feature in a macro-
like fashion.</p>
<p>Many other languages have incorporated macros, but without knowing much about it
I will go out on a limb and say that Python decorators are similar to Lisp
macros in power and possibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-goal-of-macros">
<h2>The Goal of Macros<a class="headerlink" href="#the-goal-of-macros" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I think it&#8217;s safe to say that the goal of macros in a language is to provide a
way to modify elements of the language. That&#8217;s what decorators do in Python &#8211;
they modify functions, and in the case of <em>class decorators</em>, entire classes.
This is why they usually provide a simpler alternative to metaclasses.</p>
<p>The major failings of most language&#8217;s self-modification approaches are that they
are too restrictive and that they require a different language (I&#8217;m going to say
that Java annotations with all the hoops you must jump through to produce an
interesting annotation comprises a &#8220;different language&#8221;).</p>
<p>Python falls into Fowler&#8217;s category of &#8220;enabling&#8221; languages, so if you want to
do modifications, why create a different or restricted language? Why not just
use Python itself? And that&#8217;s what Python decorators do.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-can-you-do-with-decorators">
<h2>What Can You Do With Decorators?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-can-you-do-with-decorators" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Decorators allow you to inject or modify code in functions or classes. Sounds a
bit like <em>Aspect-Oriented Programming</em> (AOP) in Java, doesn&#8217;t it? Except that
it&#8217;s both much simpler and (as a result) much more powerful. For example,
suppose you&#8217;d like to do something at the entry and exit points of a function
(such as perform some kind of security, tracing, locking, etc. &#8211; all the
standard arguments for AOP). With decorators, it looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nd">@entryExit</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">func1</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;inside func1()&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="nd">@entryExit</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">func2</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;inside func2()&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;</span></tt> indicates the application of the decorator.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="function-decorators">
<h2>Function Decorators<a class="headerlink" href="#function-decorators" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A function decorator is applied to a function definition by placing it on the
line before that function definition begins. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nd">@myDecorator</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">aFunction</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;inside aFunction&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When the compiler passes over this code, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">aFunction()</span></tt> is compiled and the
resulting function object is passed to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">myDecorator</span></tt> code, which does
something to produce a function-like object that is then substituted for the
original <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">aFunction()</span></tt>.</p>
<p>What does the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">myDecorator</span></tt> code look like? Well, most introductory examples
show this as a function, but I&#8217;ve found that it&#8217;s easier to start understanding
decorators by using classes as decoration mechanisms instead of functions. In
addition, it&#8217;s more powerful.</p>
<p>The only constraint upon the object returned by the decorator is that it can be
used as a function &#8211; which basically means it must be callable. Thus, any
classes we use as decorators must implement <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__call__</span></tt>.</p>
<p>What should the decorator do? Well, it can do anything but usually you expect
the original function code to be used at some point. This is not required,
however:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">myDecorator</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;inside myDecorator.__init__()&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c"># Prove that function definition has completed</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__call__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;inside myDecorator.__call__()&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="nd">@myDecorator</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">aFunction</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;inside aFunction()&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Finished decorating aFunction()&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">aFunction</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When you run this code, you see:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>inside myDecorator.__init__()
inside aFunction()
Finished decorating aFunction()
inside myDecorator.__call__()</pre>
</div>
<p>Notice that the constructor for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">myDecorator</span></tt> is executed at the point of
decoration of the function. Since we can call <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">f()</span></tt> inside <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__init__()</span></tt>, it
shows that the creation of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">f()</span></tt> is complete before the decorator is called.
Note also that the decorator constructor receives the function object being
decorated. Typically, you&#8217;ll capture the function object in the constructor and
later use it in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__call__()</span></tt> method (the fact that decoration and calling
are two clear phases when using classes is why I argue that it&#8217;s easier and more
powerful this way).</p>
<p>When <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">aFunction()</span></tt> is called after it has been decorated, we get completely
different behavior; the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">myDecorator.__call__()</span></tt> method is called instead of
the original code. That&#8217;s because the act of decoration <em>replaces</em> the original
function object with the result of the decoration &#8211; in our case, the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">myDecorator</span></tt> object replaces <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">aFunction</span></tt>. Indeed, before decorators were
added you had to do something much less elegant to achieve the same thing:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">():</span> <span class="k">pass</span>
<span class="n">foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">staticmethod</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>With the addition of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;</span></tt> decoration operator, you now get the same result
by saying:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nd">@staticmethod</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">():</span> <span class="k">pass</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is the reason why people argued against decorators, because the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;</span></tt> is
just a little syntax sugar meaning &#8220;pass a function object through another
function and assign the result to the original function.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reason I think decorators will have such a big impact is because this little
bit of syntax sugar changes the way you think about programming. Indeed, it
brings the idea of &#8220;applying code to other code&#8221; (i.e.: macros) into mainstream
thinking by formalizing it as a language construct.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="slightly-more-useful">
<h2>Slightly More Useful<a class="headerlink" href="#slightly-more-useful" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now let&#8217;s go back and implement the first example. Here, we&#8217;ll do the more
typical thing and actually use the code in the decorated functions:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">entryExit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">f</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__call__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Entering&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__name__</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Exited&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__name__</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="nd">@entryExit</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">func1</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;inside func1()&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="nd">@entryExit</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">func2</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;inside func2()&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">func1</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">func2</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The output is:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Entering func1
inside func1()
Exited func1
Entering func2
inside func2()
Exited func2</pre>
</div>
<p>You can see that the decorated functions now have the &#8220;Entering&#8221; and &#8220;Exited&#8221;
trace statements around the call.</p>
<p>The constructor stores the argument, which is the function object. In the call,
we use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__name__</span></tt> attribute of the function to display that function&#8217;s
name, then call the function itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-functions-as-decorators">
<h2>Using Functions as Decorators<a class="headerlink" href="#using-functions-as-decorators" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The only constraint on the result of a decorator is that it be callable, so it
can properly replace the decorated function. In the above examples, I&#8217;ve
replaced the original function with an object of a class that has a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__call__()</span></tt> method. But a function object is also callable, so we can rewrite
the previous example using a function instead of a class, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">entryExit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">new_f</span><span class="p">():</span>
        <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Entering&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__name__</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Exited&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__name__</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">new_f</span>

<span class="nd">@entryExit</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">func1</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;inside func1()&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="nd">@entryExit</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">func2</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;inside func2()&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">func1</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">func2</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">func1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__name__</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">new_f()</span></tt> is defined within the body of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">entryExit()</span></tt>, so it is created and
returned when <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">entryExit()</span></tt> is called. Note that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">new_f()</span></tt> is a <em>closure</em>,
because it captures the actual value of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">f</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Once <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">new_f()</span></tt> has been defined, it is returned from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">entryExit()</span></tt> so that
the decorator mechanism can assign the result as the decorated function.</p>
<p>The output of the line <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">print(func1.__name__)</span></tt> is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">new_f</span></tt>, because the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">new_f</span></tt> function has been substituted for the original function during
decoration. If this is a problem you can change the name of the decorator
function before you return it:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">entryExit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">new_f</span><span class="p">():</span>
        <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Entering&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__name__</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">()</span>

<p>The information you can dynamically get about functions, and the modifications

<h2>Decorators with Arguments<a class="headerlink" href="#decorators-with-arguments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The decorator mechanism behaves quite differently when you pass arguments to the
decorator.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s modify the above example to see what happens when we add arguments to the
decorator:</p>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;after second sayHello() call&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>From the output, we can see that the behavior changes quite significantly:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Inside __init__()
Inside __call__()
After decoration
Preparing to call sayHello()
Inside wrapped_f()
Decorator arguments: hello world 42
sayHello arguments: say hello argument list
After f(*args)
after first sayHello() call
Inside wrapped_f()
Decorator arguments: hello world 42
sayHello arguments: a different set of arguments
After f(*args)
after second sayHello() call</pre>
</div>
<p>Now the process of decoration calls the constructor and then immediately invokes
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__call__()</span></tt>, which can only take a single argument (the function object) and
must return the decorated function object that replaces the original. Notice
that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__call__()</span></tt> is now only invoked once, during decoration, and after that
the decorated function that you return from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__call__()</span></tt> is used for the
actual calls.</p>
<p>Although this behavior makes sense &#8211; the constructor is now used to capture the
decorator arguments, but the object <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__call__()</span></tt> can no longer be used as the
decorated function call, so you must instead use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__call__()</span></tt> to perform the
decoration &#8211; it is nonetheless surprising the first time you see it because
it&#8217;s acting so much differently than the no-argument case, and you must code the
decorator very differently from the no-argument case.</p>

</div>
<p>The return value of the decorator function must be a function used to wrap the
function to be decorated. That is, Python will take the returned function and
call it at decoration time, passing the function to be decorated. That&#8217;s why we
have three levels of functions; the inner one is the actual replacement
function.</p>
<p>Because of closures, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wrapped_f()</span></tt> has access to the decorator arguments
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">arg1</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">arg2</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">arg3</span></tt>, <em>without</em> having to explicitly store them as in
the class version. However, this is a case where I find &#8220;explicit is better than
implicit,&#8221; so even though the function version is more succinct I find the class
version easier to understand and thus to modify and maintain.</p>
