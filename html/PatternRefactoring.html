<p>This chapter will look at the process of solving a problem by applying design
patterns in an evolutionary fashion. That is, a first cut design will be used
for the initial solution, and then this solution will be examined and various
design patterns will be applied to the problem (some of which will work, and
some of which won&#8217;t). The key question that will always be asked in seeking
improved solutions is &#8220;what will change?&#8221;</p>
<p>This process is similar to what Martin Fowler talks about in his book
<em>Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code [#]_</em> (although he tends to
talk about pieces of code more than pattern-level designs). You start with a
solution, and then when you discover that it doesn&#8217;t continue to meet your
needs, you fix it. Of course, this is a natural tendency but in computer
programming it&#8217;s been extremely difficult to accomplish with procedural
programs, and the acceptance of the idea that we <em>can</em> refactor code and designs
adds to the body of proof that object-oriented programming is &#8220;a good thing.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Simulating the Trash Recycler<a class="headerlink" href="#simulating-the-trash-recycler" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The nature of this problem is that the trash is thrown unclassified into a
single bin, so the specific type information is lost. But later, the specific
type information must be recovered to properly sort the trash. In the initial
solution, RTTI (described in <em>Thinking in Java</em>) is used.</p>
<p>This is not a trivial design because it has an added constraint. That&#8217;s what
makes it interesting-it&#8217;s more like the messy problems you&#8217;re likely to
encounter in your work. The extra constraint is that the trash arrives at the
trash recycling plant all mixed together. The program must model the sorting of
that trash. This is where RTTI comes in: you have a bunch of anonymous pieces of
trash, and the program figures out exactly what type they are:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre># PatternRefactoring/recyclea/RecycleA.py

<p>In the source code listings available for this book, this file will be placed in
the subdirectory <strong>recyclea</strong> that branches off from the subdirectory
<strong>patternRefactoring</strong>. The unpacking tool takes care of placing it into the
correct subdirectory. The reason for doing this is that this chapter rewrites
this particular example a number of times and by putting each version in its own
directory (using the default package in each directory so that invoking the
program is easy), the class names will not clash.</p>
<p>Several <strong>ArrayList</strong> objects are created to hold <strong>Trash</strong> references. Of
course, <strong>ArrayList</strong>s actually hold <strong>Object</strong>s so they&#8217;ll hold anything at
all. The reason they hold <strong>Trash</strong> (or something derived from <strong>Trash</strong>) is
only because you&#8217;ve been careful to not put in anything except <strong>Trash</strong>. If you
do put something &#8220;wrong&#8221; into the <strong>ArrayList</strong>, you won&#8217;t get any compile-time
warnings or errors-you&#8217;ll find out only via an exception at run time.</p>
<p>When the <strong>Trash</strong> references are added, they lose their specific identities and
become simply <strong>Object reference</strong>s (they are <em>upcast</em>). However, because of
polymorphism the proper behavior still occurs when the dynamically-bound methods
are called through the <strong>Iterator sorter</strong>, once the resulting <strong>Object</strong> has
been cast back to <strong>Trash</strong>. <strong>sumValue( )</strong> also takes an <strong>Iterator</strong> to
perform operations on every object in the <strong>ArrayList</strong>.</p>
<p>It looks silly to upcast the types of <strong>Trash</strong> into a container holding base
type references, and then turn around and downcast. Why not just put the trash
into the appropriate receptacle in the first place? (Indeed, this is the whole
enigma of recycling). In this program it would be easy to repair, but sometimes
a system&#8217;s structure and flexibility can benefit greatly from downcasting.</p>
<p>The program satisfies the design requirements: it works. This might be fine as
long as it&#8217;s a one-shot solution. However, a useful program tends to evolve over
time, so you must ask, &#8220;What if the situation changes?&#8221; For example, cardboard
is now a valuable recyclable commodity, so how will that be integrated into the
system (especially if the program is large and complicated). Since the above
type-check coding in the <strong>switch</strong> statement could be scattered throughout the
program, you must go find all that code every time a new type is added, and if
you miss one the compiler won&#8217;t give you any help by pointing out an error.</p>
<p>The key to the misuse of RTTI here is that <em>every type is tested</em>. If you&#8217;re
looking for only a subset of types because that subset needs special treatment,
that&#8217;s probably fine. But if you&#8217;re hunting for every type inside a switch
statement, then you&#8217;re probably missing an important point, and definitely
making your code less maintainable. In the next section we&#8217;ll look at how this
program evolved over several stages to become much more flexible. This should
prove a valuable example in program design.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="improving-the-design">
<h2>Improving the Design<a class="headerlink" href="#improving-the-design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The solutions in <em>Design Patterns</em> are organized around the question &#8220;What will
change as this program evolves?&#8221; This is usually the most important question
that you can ask about any design. If you can build your system around the
answer, the results will be two-pronged: not only will your system allow easy
(and inexpensive) maintenance, but you might also produce components that are
reusable, so that other systems can be built more cheaply. This is the promise
of object-oriented programming, but it doesn&#8217;t happen automatically; it requires
thought and insight on your part. In this section we&#8217;ll see how this process can
happen during the refinement of a system.</p>
<p>The answer to the question &#8220;What will change?&#8221; for the recycling system is a
common one: more types will be added to the system. The goal of the design,
then, is to make this addition of types as painless as possible. In the
recycling program, we&#8217;d like to encapsulate all places where specific type
information is mentioned, so (if for no other reason) any changes can be
localized to those encapsulations. It turns out that this process also cleans up
the rest of the code considerably.</p>
<div class="section" id="make-more-objects">
<h3>&#8220;Make More Objects&#8221;<a class="headerlink" href="#make-more-objects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This brings up a general object-oriented design principle that I first heard
spoken by Grady Booch: &#8220;If the design is too complicated, make more objects.&#8221;
This is simultaneously counterintuitive and ludicrously simple, and yet it&#8217;s the
most useful guideline I&#8217;ve found. (You might observe that &#8220;making more objects&#8221;
is often equivalent to &#8220;add another level of indirection.&#8221;) In general, if you
find a place with messy code, consider what sort of class would clean that up.
Often the side effect of cleaning up the code will be a system that has better
structure and is more flexible.</p>
<p>Consider first the place where <strong>Trash</strong> objects are created, which is a
<strong>switch</strong> statement inside <strong>main( )</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre># PatternRefactoring/clip1.py
    for(int i = 0 i &lt; 30 i++)
        switch((int)(Math.random() * 3)):
            case 0 :
                bin.add(new
                  Aluminum(Math.random() * 100))
                break
            case 1 :
                bin.add(new
                  Paper(Math.random() * 100))
                break
            case 2 :
                bin.add(new
                  Glass(Math.random() * 100))</pre>
</div>
<p>This is definitely messy, and also a place where you must change code whenever a
new type is added. If new types are commonly added, a better solution is a
single method that takes all of the necessary information and produces a
reference to an object of the correct type, already upcast to a trash object. In
<em>Design Patterns</em> this is broadly referred to as a <em>creational pattern</em> (of
which there are several). The specific pattern that will be applied here is a
variant of the <em>Factory Method</em>. Here, the factory method is a <strong>static</strong> member
of <strong>Trash</strong>, but more commonly it is a method that is overridden in the derived
class.</p>
<p>The idea of the factory method is that you pass it the essential information it
needs to know to create your object, then stand back and wait for the reference
(already upcast to the base type) to pop out as the return value. From then on,
you treat the object polymorphically. Thus, you never even need to know the
exact type of object that&#8217;s created. In fact, the factory method hides it from
you to prevent accidental misuse. If you want to use the object without
polymorphism, you must explicitly use RTTI and casting.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a little problem, especially when you use the more complicated
approach (not shown here) of making the factory method in the base class and
overriding it in the derived classes. What if the information required in the
derived class requires more or different arguments? &#8220;Creating more objects&#8221;
solves this problem. To implement the factory method, the <strong>Trash</strong> class gets a
new method called <strong>factory</strong>. To hide the creational data, there&#8217;s a new class
called <strong>Messenger</strong> that carries all of the necessary information for the
<strong>factory</strong> method to create the appropriate <strong>Trash</strong> object (we&#8217;ve started
referring to <em>Messenger</em> as a design pattern, but it&#8217;s simple enough that you
may not choose to elevate it to that status). Here&#8217;s a simple implementation of
<strong>Messenger</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># PatternRefactoring/clip2.py</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Messenger</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="c"># Must change this to add another type:</span>
    <span class="n">MAX_NUM</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">4</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">typeNum</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">val</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">type</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">typeNum</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">MAX_NUM</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">val</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A <strong>Messenger</strong> object&#8217;s only job is to hold information for the <strong>factory( )</strong>
method. Now, if there&#8217;s a situation in which <strong>factory( )</strong> needs more or
different information to create a new type of <strong>Trash</strong> object, the <strong>factory(
)</strong> interface doesn&#8217;t need to be changed. The <strong>Messenger</strong> class can be changed
by adding new data and new constructors, or in the more typical object-oriented
fashion of subclassing.</p>
<p>The <strong>factory( )</strong> method for this simple example looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre># PatternRefactoring/clip3.py
    def factory(messenger):
        switch(messenger.type):
            default: # To quiet the compiler
            case 0:
                return Aluminum(messenger.data)
            case 1:
                return Paper(messenger.data)
            case 2:
                return Glass(messenger.data)
            # Two lines here:
            case 3:
                return Cardboard(messenger.data)</pre>
</div>
<p>Here, the determination of the exact type of object is simple, but you can
imagine a more complicated system in which <strong>factory( )</strong> uses an elaborate
algorithm. The point is that it&#8217;s now hidden away in one place, and you know to
come to this place when you add new types.</p>
<p>The creation of new objects is now much simpler in <strong>main( )</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre># PatternRefactoring/clip4.py
    for(int i = 0 i &lt; 30 i++)
        bin.add(
          Trash.factory(
            Messenger(
              (int)(Math.random() * Messenger.MAX_NUM),
              Math.random() * 100)))</pre>
</div>
<p>A <strong>Messenger</strong> object is created to pass the data into <strong>factory( )</strong>, which in
turn produces some kind of <strong>Trash</strong> object on the heap and returns the
reference that&#8217;s added to the <strong>ArrayList bin</strong>. Of course, if you change the
quantity and type of argument, this statement will still need to be modified,
but that can be eliminated if the creation of the <strong>Messenger</strong> object is
automated. For example, an <strong>ArrayList</strong> of arguments can be passed into the
constructor of a <strong>Messenger</strong> object (or directly into a <strong>factory( )</strong> call,
for that matter). This requires that the arguments be parsed and checked at run
time, but it does provide the greatest flexibility.</p>
<p>You can see from this code what &#8220;vector of change&#8221; problem the factory is
responsible for solving: if you add new types to the system (the change), the
only code that must be modified is within the factory, so the factory isolates
the effect of that change.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-pattern-for-prototyping-creation">
<h2>A Pattern for Prototyping Creation<a class="headerlink" href="#a-pattern-for-prototyping-creation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A problem with the design above is that it still requires a central location
where all the types of the objects must be known: inside the <strong>factory( )</strong>
method. If new types are regularly being added to the system, the <strong>factory( )</strong>
method must be changed for each new type. When you discover something like this,
it is useful to try to go one step further and move <em>all</em> of the information
about the type-including its creation-into the class representing that type.
This way, the only thing you need to do to add a new type to the system is to
inherit a single class.</p>
<p>To move the information concerning type creation into each specific type of
<strong>Trash</strong>, the &#8220;prototype&#8221; pattern (from the <em>Design Patterns</em> book) will be
used. The general idea is that you have a master sequence of objects, one of
each type you&#8217;re interested in making. The objects in this sequence are used
<em>only</em> for making new objects, using an operation that&#8217;s not unlike the <strong>clone(
)</strong> scheme built into Java&#8217;s root class <strong>Object</strong>. In this case, we&#8217;ll name the
cloning method <strong>tClone( )</strong>. When you&#8217;re ready to make a new object, presumably
you have some sort of information that establishes the type of object you want
to create, then you move through the master sequence comparing your information
with whatever appropriate information is in the prototype objects in the master
sequence. When you find one that matches your needs, you clone it.</p>
<p>In this scheme there is no hard-coded information for creation. Each object
knows how to expose appropriate information and how to clone itself. Thus, the
<strong>factory( )</strong> method doesn&#8217;t need to be changed when a new type is added to the
system.</p>
<p>One approach to the problem of prototyping is to add a number of methods to
support the creation of new objects. However, in Java 1.1 there&#8217;s already
support for creating new objects if you have a reference to the <strong>Class</strong>
object. With Java 1.1 <em>reflection</em> (introduced in <em>Thinking in Java</em>) you can
call a constructor even if you have only a reference to the <strong>Class</strong> object.
This is the perfect solution for the prototyping problem.</p>
<p>The list of prototypes will be represented indirectly by a list of references to
all the <strong>Class</strong> objects you want to create. In addition, if the prototyping
fails, the <strong>factory( )</strong> method will assume that it&#8217;s because a particular
<strong>Class</strong> object wasn&#8217;t in the list, and it will attempt to load it. By loading
the prototypes dynamically like this, the <strong>Trash</strong> class doesn&#8217;t need to know
what types it is working with, so it doesn&#8217;t need any modifications when you add
new types. This allows it to be easily reused throughout the rest of the
chapter:</p>

                       return (Trash)ctor.newInstance()
                   except ex:
                       ex.printStackTrace(System.err)
                       raise "Cannot Create Trash"

           # Class was not in the list. Try to load it,
           # but it must be in your class path!
           try:
               print("Loading " + info.id)
               trashTypes.add(Class.forName(info.id))
           except e:
               e.printStackTrace(System.err)
               raise "Prototype not found"

           # Loaded successfully.
           # Recursive call should work:
           return factory(info)

       class Messenger:
           def __init__(self, name, val):
               self.id = name
               self.data = val

The basic **Trash** class and **sumValue( )** remain as before. The rest of the
class supports the prototyping pattern. You first see two inner classes (which
are made **static**, so they are inner classes only for code organization
purposes) describing exceptions that can occur. This is followed by an
**ArrayList** called **trashTypes**, which is used to hold the **Class**
references.</pre>
</div>
<p>In <strong>Trash.factory( )</strong>, the <strong>String</strong> inside the <strong>Messenger</strong> object <strong>id</strong>
(a different version of the <strong>Messenger</strong> class than that of the prior
discussion) contains the type name of the <strong>Trash</strong> to be created; this
<strong>String</strong> is compared to the <strong>Class</strong> names in the list. If there&#8217;s a match,
then that&#8217;s the object to create. Of course, there are many ways to determine
what object you want to make. This one is used so that information read in from
a file can be turned into objects.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve discovered which kind of <strong>Trash</strong> to create, then the reflection
methods come into play. The <strong>getConstructor( )</strong> method takes an argument
that&#8217;s an array of <strong>Class</strong> references. This array represents the arguments, in
their proper order, for the constructor that you&#8217;re looking for. Here, the array
is dynamically created using the Java 1.1 array-creation syntax:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Class[]:double.class</pre>
</div>
<p>This code assumes that every <strong>Trash</strong> type has a constructor that takes a
<strong>double</strong> (and notice that <strong>double.class</strong> is distinct from <strong>Double.class</strong>).
It&#8217;s also possible, for a more flexible solution, to call <strong>getConstructors(
)</strong>, which returns an array of the possible constructors.</p>
<p>What comes back from <strong>getConstructor( )</strong> is a reference to a <strong>Constructor</strong>
object (part of <strong>java.lang.reflect</strong>). You call the constructor dynamically
with the method <strong>newInstance( )</strong>, which takes an array of <strong>Object</strong>
containing the actual arguments. This array is again created using the Java 1.1
syntax:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Object[]{Double(Messenger.data)</pre>
</div>
<p>In this case, however, the <strong>double</strong> must be placed inside a wrapper class so
that it can be part of this array of objects. The process of calling
<strong>newInstance( )</strong> extracts the <strong>double</strong>, but you can see it is a bit
confusing-an argument might be a <strong>double</strong> or a <strong>Double</strong>, but when you make
the call you must always pass in a <strong>Double</strong>. Fortunately, this issue exists
only for the primitive types.</p>
<p>Once you understand how to do it, the process of creating a new object given
only a <strong>Class</strong> reference is remarkably simple. Reflection also allows you to
call methods in this same dynamic fashion.</p>
<p>Of course, the appropriate <strong>Class</strong> reference might not be in the
<strong>trashTypes</strong> list. In this case, the <strong>return</strong> in the inner loop is never
executed and you&#8217;ll drop out at the end. Here, the program tries to rectify the
situation by loading the <strong>Class</strong> object dynamically and adding it to the
<strong>trashTypes</strong> list. If it still can&#8217;t be found something is really wrong, but
if the load is successful then the <strong>factory</strong> method is called recursively to
try again.</p>
<p>As you&#8217;ll see, the beauty of this design is that this code doesn&#8217;t need to be
changed, regardless of the different situations it will be used in (assuming
that all <strong>Trash</strong> subclasses contain a constructor that takes a single
<strong>double</strong> argument).</p>
<div class="section" id="trash-subclasses">
<h3><strong>Trash</strong> Subclasses<a class="headerlink" href="#trash-subclasses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To fit into the prototyping scheme, the only thing that&#8217;s required of each new
subclass of <strong>Trash</strong> is that it contain a constructor that takes a <strong>double</strong>
argument. Java reflection handles everything else.</p>
<p>Here are the different types of <strong>Trash</strong>, each in their own file but part of
the <strong>Trash</strong> package (again, to facilitate reuse within the chapter):</p>

<p>This file is read using the previously-defined <strong>StringList</strong> tool, and each

)</strong> to extract the name of the trash type, and next to get the weight that is
turned into a <strong>double</strong> with the <strong>static Double.valueOf( )</strong> method. The
<strong>trim( )</strong> method removes white space at both ends of a string.</p>
<p>The <strong>Trash</strong> parser is placed in a separate file since it will be reused
throughout this chapter:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre># PatternRefactoring/trash/ParseTrash.py
# Parse file contents into Trash objects,
# placing each into a Fillable holder.

class ParseTrash:
    def fillBin(String filename, Fillable bin):
        for line in open(filename).readlines():
            String type = line.substring(0,
              line.index(':')).strip()
            weight = Double.valueOf(
              line.substring(line.index(':') + 1)
                .strip()).doubleValue()
            bin.addTrash(
              Trash.factory(
                Trash.Messenger(type, weight)))

    # Special case to handle Collection:
    def fillBin(String filename, Bin):
        fillBin(filename, FillableCollection(bin))</pre>
</div>
<p>In <strong>RecycleA.py</strong>, an <strong>ArrayList</strong> was used to hold the <strong>Trash</strong> objects.
However, other types of containers can be used as well. To allow for this, the
first version of <strong>fillBin( )</strong> takes a reference to a <strong>Fillable</strong>, which is
simply an <strong>interface</strong> that supports a method called <strong>addTrash( )</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre># PatternRefactoring/trash/Fillable.py
# Any object that can be filled with Trash.

class Fillable:
    def addTrash(self, Trash t)</pre>
</div>
<p>Anything that supports this interface can be used with <strong>fillBin</strong>. Of course,
<strong>Collection</strong> doesn&#8217;t implement <strong>Fillable</strong>, so it won&#8217;t work. Since
<strong>Collection</strong> is used in most of the examples, it makes sense to add a second
overloaded <strong>fillBin( )</strong> method that takes a <strong>Collection</strong>. Any <strong>Collection</strong>
can then be used as a <strong>Fillable</strong> object using an adapter class:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># PatternRefactoring/trash/FillableCollection.py</span>
<span class="c"># Adapter that makes a Collection Fillable.</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">FillableCollection</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Fillable</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">cc</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">cc</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">addTrash</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can see that the only job of this class is to connect <strong>Fillable</strong>&#8216;s
<strong>addTrash( )</strong> method to <strong>Collection</strong>&#8216;s <strong>add( )</strong>. With this class in hand,
the overloaded <strong>fillBin( )</strong> method can be used with a <strong>Collection</strong> in
<strong>ParseTrash.py</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">fillBin</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">bin</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">fillBin</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">FillableCollection</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bin</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This approach works for any container class that&#8217;s used frequently.
Alternatively, the container class can provide its own adapter that implements
<strong>Fillable</strong>. (You&#8217;ll see this later, in <strong>DynaTrash.py</strong>.)</p>

<div class="section" id="recycling-with-prototyping">
<h3>Recycling with Prototyping<a class="headerlink" href="#recycling-with-prototyping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Now you can see the revised version of <strong>RecycleA.py</strong> using the prototyping
technique:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre># PatternRefactoring/recycleap/RecycleAP.py
# Recycling with RTTI and Prototypes.

class RecycleAP(UnitTest):
    Collection
        bin = ArrayList(),
        glassBin = ArrayList(),
        paperBin = ArrayList(),
        alBin = ArrayList()
    def __init__(self):
        # Fill up the Trash bin:
        ParseTrash.fillBin(
          "../trash/Trash.dat", bin)

    def test(self):
        Iterator sorter = bin.iterator()
        # Sort the Trash:
        while(sorter.hasNext()):
            Object t = sorter.next()
            # RTTI to show class membership:
            if(t instanceof Aluminum)
                alBin.add(t)
            if(t instanceof Paper)
                paperBin.add(t)
            if(t instanceof Glass)
                glassBin.add(t)

        Trash.sumValue(alBin.iterator())
        Trash.sumValue(paperBin.iterator())
        Trash.sumValue(glassBin.iterator())
        Trash.sumValue(bin.iterator())

    def main(self, String args[]):
        RecycleAP().test()</pre>
</div>
<p>All of the <strong>Trash</strong> objects, as well as the <strong>ParseTrash</strong> and support classes,
are now part of the package <strong>patternRefactoring.trash</strong>, so they are simply
imported.</p>
<p>The process of opening the data file containing <strong>Trash</strong> descriptions and the
parsing of that file have been wrapped into the <strong>static</strong> method
<strong>ParseTrash.fillBin( )</strong>, so now it&#8217;s no longer a part of our design focus. You
will see that throughout the rest of the chapter, no matter what new classes are
added, <strong>ParseTrash.fillBin( )</strong> will continue to work without change, which
indicates a good design.</p>
<p>In terms of object creation, this design does indeed severely localize the
changes you need to make to add a new type to the system. However, there&#8217;s a
significant problem in the use of RTTI that shows up clearly here. The program
seems to run fine, and yet it never detects any cardboard, even though there is
cardboard in the list! This happens <em>because</em> of the use of RTTI, which looks
for only the types that you tell it to look for. The clue that RTTI is being
misused is that <em>every type in the system</em> is being tested, rather than a single
type or subset of types. As you will see later, there are ways to use
polymorphism instead when you&#8217;re testing for every type. But if you use RTTI a
lot in this fashion, and you add a new type to your system, you can easily
forget to make the necessary changes in your program and produce a difficult-to-
find bug. So it&#8217;s worth trying to eliminate RTTI in this case, not just for
aesthetic reasons-it produces more maintainable code.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="abstracting-usage">
<h2>Abstracting Usage<a class="headerlink" href="#abstracting-usage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>With creation out of the way, it&#8217;s time to tackle the remainder of the design:
where the classes are used. Since it&#8217;s the act of sorting into bins that&#8217;s
particularly ugly and exposed, why not take that process and hide it inside a
class? This is the principle of &#8220;If you must do something ugly, at least
localize the ugliness inside a class.&#8221; It looks like this:</p>
<img alt="_images/trashSorter1.gif" src="_images/trashSorter1.gif" />
<p>The <strong>TrashSorter</strong> object initialization must now be changed whenever a new type of <strong>Trash</strong> is added to the model. You could imagine that the <strong>TrashSorter</strong> class might look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>class TrashSorter(ArrayList):
  def sort(self, Trash t): /* ... */</pre>
</div>
<p>That is, <strong>TrashSorter</strong> is an <strong>ArrayList</strong> of references to <strong>ArrayList</strong>s of <strong>Trash</strong> references, and with <strong>add( )</strong> you can install another one, like so:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>TrashSorter ts = TrashSorter()
ts.add(ArrayList())</pre>
</div>
<p>Now, however, <strong>sort( )</strong> becomes a problem. How does the statically-coded
method deal with the fact that a new type has been added? To solve this, the
type information must be removed from <strong>sort( )</strong> so that all it needs to do is
call a generic method that takes care of the details of type. This, of course,
is another way to describe a dynamically-bound method. So <strong>sort( )</strong> will
simply move through the sequence and call a dynamically-bound method for each
<strong>ArrayList</strong>. Since the job of this method is to grab the pieces of trash it is
interested in, it&#8217;s called <strong>grab(Trash)</strong>. The structure now looks like:</p>
<img alt="_images/trashSorter2.gif" src="_images/trashSorter2.gif" />
<p><strong>TrashSorter</strong> needs to call each <strong>grab( )</strong> method and get a different result
depending on what type of <strong>Trash</strong> the current <strong>ArrayList</strong> is holding. That
is, each <strong>ArrayList</strong> must be aware of the type it holds. The classic approach
to this problem is to create a base <strong>Trash</strong> bin class and inherit a new
derived class for each different type you want to hold. If Java had a
parameterized type mechanism that would probably be the most straightforward
approach. But rather than hand-coding all the classes that such a mechanism
should be building for us, further observation can produce a better approach.</p>
<p>A basic OOP design principle is &#8220;Use data members for variation in state, use
polymorphism for variation in behavior.&#8221; Your first thought might be that the
<strong>grab( )</strong> method certainly behaves differently for an <strong>ArrayList</strong> that holds
<strong>Paper</strong> than for one that holds <strong>Glass</strong>. But what it does is strictly
dependent on the type, and nothing else. This could be interpreted as a
different state, and since Java has a class to represent type (<strong>Class</strong>) this
can be used to determine the type of <strong>Trash</strong> a particular <strong>Tbin</strong> will hold.</p>
<p>The constructor for this <strong>Tbin</strong> requires that you hand it the <strong>Class</strong> of
your choice. This tells the <strong>ArrayList</strong> what type it is supposed to hold. Then
the <strong>grab( )</strong> method uses <strong>Class BinType</strong> and RTTI to see if the <strong>Trash</strong>
object you&#8217;ve handed it matches the type it&#8217;s supposed to grab.</p>
<p>Here is the new version of the program:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre># PatternRefactoring/recycleb/RecycleB.py
# Containers that grab objects of interest.

# A container that admits only the right type
# of Trash (established in the constructor):
class Tbin:
    def __init__(self, binType):
        self.list = ArrayList()
        self.type = binType
    def grab(self, t):
        # Comparing class types:
        if(t.getClass().equals(self.type)):
            self.list.add(t)
            return True # Object grabbed

        return False # Object not grabbed

    def iterator(self):
        return self.list.iterator()

class TbinList(ArrayList):
    def sort(self, Trash t):
        Iterator e = iterator() # Iterate over self
        while(e.hasNext())
            if(((Tbin)e.next()).grab(t)) return
        # Need a Tbin for this type:
        add(Tbin(t.getClass()))
        sort(t) # Recursive call

class RecycleB(UnitTest):
    Bin = ArrayList()
    TbinList trashBins = TbinList()
    def __init__(self):
        ParseTrash.fillBin("../trash/Trash.dat",bin)

    def test(self):
        Iterator it = bin.iterator()
        while(it.hasNext())
            trashBins.sort((Trash)it.next())
        Iterator e = trashBins.iterator()
        while(e.hasNext()):
            Tbin b = (Tbin)e.next()
            Trash.sumValue(b.iterator())

        Trash.sumValue(bin.iterator())

    def main(self, String args[]):
        RecycleB().test()</pre>
</div>
<p><strong>Tbin</strong> contains a <strong>Class</strong> reference <strong>type</strong> which establishes in the
constructor what what type it should grab. The <strong>grab()</strong> method checks this
type against the object you pass it. Note that in this design, <strong>grab()</strong> only
accepts <strong>Trash</strong> objects so you get compile-time type checking on the base
type, but you could also just accept <strong>Object</strong> and it would still work.</p>
<p><strong>TTbinList</strong> holds a set of <strong>Tbin</strong> references, so that <strong>sort( )</strong> can
iterate through the <strong>Tbin</strong>s when it&#8217;s looking for a match for the <strong>Trash</strong>
object you&#8217;ve handed it. If it doesn&#8217;t find a match, it creates a new <strong>Tbin</strong>
for the type that hasn&#8217;t been found, and makes a recursive call to itself - the
next time around, the new bin will be found.</p>
<p>Notice the genericity of this code: it doesn&#8217;t change at all if new types are
added. If the bulk of your code doesn&#8217;t need changing when a new type is added
(or some other change occurs) then you have an easily extensible system.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multiple-dispatching">
<h2>Multiple Dispatching<a class="headerlink" href="#multiple-dispatching" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The above design is certainly satisfactory. Adding new types to the system
consists of adding or modifying distinct classes without causing code changes to
be propagated throughout the system. In addition, RTTI is not &#8220;misused&#8221; as it
was in <strong>RecycleA.py</strong>. However, it&#8217;s possible to go one step further and take a
purist viewpoint about RTTI and say that it should be eliminated altogether from
the operation of sorting the trash into bins.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, you must first take the perspective that all type-dependent
activities-such as detecting the type of a piece of trash and putting it into
the appropriate bin-should be controlled through polymorphism and dynamic
binding.</p>
<p>The previous examples first sorted by type, then acted on sequences of elements
that were all of a particular type. But whenever you find yourself picking out
particular types, stop and think. The whole idea of polymorphism (dynamically-
bound method calls) is to handle type-specific information for you. So why are
you hunting for types?</p>
<p>The answer is something you probably don&#8217;t think about: Python performs only
single dispatching. That is, if you are performing an operation on more than one
object whose type is unknown, Python will invoke the dynamic binding mechanism
on only one of those types. This doesn&#8217;t solve the problem, so you end up
detecting some types manually and effectively producing your own dynamic binding
behavior.</p>
<p>The solution is called <em>multiple dispatching</em>, which means setting up a
configuration such that a single method call produces more than one dynamic
method call and thus determines more than one type in the process. To get this
effect, you need to work with more than one type hierarchy: you&#8217;ll need a type
hierarchy for each dispatch. The following example works with two hierarchies:
the existing <strong>Trash</strong> family and a hierarchy of the types of trash bins that
the trash will be placed into. This second hierarchy isn&#8217;t always obvious and in
this case it needed to be created in order to produce multiple dispatching (in
this case there will be only two dispatches, which is referred to as <em>double
dispatching</em>).</p>
<div class="section" id="implementing-the-double-dispatch">
<h3>Implementing the Double Dispatch<a class="headerlink" href="#implementing-the-double-dispatch" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Remember that polymorphism can occur only via method calls, so if you want
double dispatching to occur, there must be two method calls: one used to
determine the type within each hierarchy. In the Trash hierarchy there will be a
new method called addToBin( ), which takes an argument of an array of TypedBin.
It uses this array to step through and try to add itself to the appropriate bin,
and this is where you&#8217;ll see the double dispatch.</p>
<img alt="_images/trashSorter3.gif" src="_images/trashSorter3.gif" />
<p>The new hierarchy is TypedBin, and it contains its own method called add( ) that
is also used polymorphically. But here&#8217;s an additional twist: add( ) is
overloaded to take arguments of the different types of trash. So an essential
part of the double dispatching scheme also involves overloading.</p>
<p>Redesigning the program produces a dilemma: it&#8217;s now necessary for the base
class <strong>Trash</strong> to contain an <strong>addToBin( )</strong> method. One approach is to copy
all of the code and change the base class. Another approach, which you can take
when you don&#8217;t have control of the source code, is to put the <strong>addToBin( )</strong>
method into an <strong>interface</strong>, leave <strong>Trash</strong> alone, and inherit new specific
types of <strong>Aluminum</strong>, <strong>Paper</strong>, <strong>Glass</strong>, and <strong>Cardboard</strong>. This is the
approach that will be taken here.</p>
<p>Most of the classes in this design must be <strong>public</strong>, so they are placed in
their own files. Here&#8217;s the interface:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre># PatternRefactoring/doubledispatch/TypedBinMember.py
# An class for adding the double
# dispatching method to the trash hierarchy
# without modifying the original hierarchy.

class TypedBinMember:
    # The method:
    boolean addToBin(TypedBin[] tb)</pre>
</div>
<p>In each particular subtype of <strong>Aluminum</strong>, <strong>Paper</strong>, <strong>Glass,</strong> and
<strong>Cardboard</strong>, the <strong>addToBin( )</strong> method in the <strong>interface TypedBinMember</strong> is
implemented, but it <em>looks</em> like the code is exactly the same in each case:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre># PatternRefactoring/doubledispatch/DDAluminum.py
# Aluminum for double dispatching.

class DDAluminum(Aluminum, TypedBinMember):
    def __init__(self, wt): Aluminum.__init__(wt)
    def addToBin(self, TypedBin[] tb):
        for(int i = 0 i &lt; tb.length i++)
            if(tb[i].add(self)):
                return True
        return False::


# PatternRefactoring/doubledispatch/DDPaper.py
# Paper for double dispatching.

class DDPaper(Paper, TypedBinMember):
    def __init__(self, wt): Paper.__init__(wt)
    def addToBin(self, TypedBin[] tb):
        for(int i = 0 i &lt; tb.length i++)
            if(tb[i].add(self))
                return True
        return False::


# PatternRefactoring/doubledispatch/DDGlass.py
# Glass for double dispatching.

class DDGlass(Glass, TypedBinMember):
    def __init__(self, wt): Glass.__init__(wt)
    def addToBin(self, TypedBin[] tb):
        for(int i = 0 i &lt; tb.length i++)
            if(tb[i].add(self))
                return True
        return False::


# PatternRefactoring/doubledispatch/DDCardboard.py
# Cardboard for double dispatching.

class DDCardboard(Cardboard, TypedBinMember):
    def __init__(self, wt):
        Cardboard.__init__(wt)
    def addToBin(self, TypedBin[] tb):
        for(int i = 0 i &lt; tb.length i++)
            if(tb[i].add(self))
                return True
        return False</pre>
</div>
<p>The code in each <strong>addToBin( )</strong> calls <strong>add( )</strong> for each <strong>TypedBin</strong> object
in the array. But notice the argument: <strong>this</strong>. The type of <strong>this</strong> is
different for each subclass of <strong>Trash</strong>, so the code is different. (Although
this code will benefit if a parameterized type mechanism is ever added to Java.)
So this is the first part of the double dispatch, because once you&#8217;re inside
this method you know you&#8217;re <strong>Aluminum</strong>, or <strong>Paper</strong>, etc. During the call to
<strong>add( )</strong>, this information is passed via the type of <strong>this</strong>. The compiler
resolves the call to the proper overloaded version of <strong>add( )</strong>. But since
<strong>tb[i]</strong> produces a reference to the base type <strong>TypedBin</strong>, this call will end
up calling a different method depending on the type of <strong>TypedBin</strong> that&#8217;s
currently selected. That is the second dispatch.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the base class for <strong>TypedBin</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre># PatternRefactoring/doubledispatch/TypedBin.py
# A container for the second dispatch.

class TypedBin:
    c = ArrayList()
    def addIt(self, Trash t):
        c.add(t)
        return True

    def iterator(self):
        return c.iterator()

    def add(self, DDAluminum a):
        return False

    def add(self, DDPaper a):
        return False

    def add(self, DDGlass a):
        return False

    def add(self, DDCardboard a):
        return False</pre>
</div>
<p>You can see that the overloaded <strong>add( )</strong> methods all return <strong>false</strong>. If the
method is not overloaded in a derived class, it will continue to return
<strong>false</strong>, and the caller (<strong>addToBin( )</strong>, in this case) will assume that the
current <strong>Trash</strong> object has not been added successfully to a container, and
continue searching for the right container.</p>
<p>In each of the subclasses of <strong>TypedBin</strong>, only one overloaded method is
overridden, according to the type of bin that&#8217;s being created. For example,
<strong>CardboardBin</strong> overrides <strong>add(DDCardboard)</strong>. The overridden method adds the
trash object to its container and returns <strong>true</strong>, while all the rest of the
<strong>add( )</strong> methods in <strong>CardboardBin</strong> continue to return <strong>false</strong>, since they
haven&#8217;t been overridden. This is another case in which a parameterized type
mechanism in Java would allow automatic generation of code. (With C++
<strong>template</strong>s, you wouldn&#8217;t have to explicitly write the subclasses or place
the <strong>addToBin( )</strong> method in <strong>Trash</strong>.)</p>
<p>Since for this example the trash types have been customized and placed in a
different directory, you&#8217;ll need a different trash data file to make it work.
Here&#8217;s a possible <strong>DDTrash.dat</strong>:</p>

    def test(self):
        # Sort from the master bin into

</div>
<p><strong>TrashBinSet</strong> encapsulates all of the different types of <strong>TypedBin</strong>s, along
with the <strong>sortIntoBins( )</strong> method, which is where all the double dispatching
takes place. You can see that once the structure is set up, sorting into the
various <strong>TypedBin</strong>s is remarkably easy. In addition, the efficiency of two
dynamic method calls is probably better than any other way you could sort.</p>
<p>Notice the ease of use of this system in <strong>main( )</strong>, as well as the complete
independence of any specific type information within <strong>main( )</strong>. All other
methods that talk only to the <strong>Trash</strong> base-class interface will be equally
invulnerable to changes in <strong>Trash</strong> types.</p>
<p>The changes necessary to add a new type are relatively isolated: you modify
<strong>TypedBin</strong>, inherit the new type of <strong>Trash</strong> with its <strong>addToBin( )</strong> method,
then inherit a new <strong>TypedBin</strong> (this is really just a copy and simple edit),
and finally add a new type into the aggregate initialization for
<strong>TrashBinSet</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-visitor-pattern">
<h2>The <em>Visitor</em> Pattern<a class="headerlink" href="#the-visitor-pattern" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now consider applying a design pattern that has an entirely different goal to
the trash sorting problem.</p>
<p>For this pattern, we are no longer concerned with optimizing the addition of new
types of <strong>Trash</strong> to the system. Indeed, this pattern makes adding a new type
of <strong>Trash</strong> <em>more</em> complicated. The assumption is that you have a primary class
hierarchy that is fixed; perhaps it&#8217;s from another vendor and you can&#8217;t make
changes to that hierarchy. However, you&#8217;d like to add new polymorphic methods to
that hierarchy, which means that normally you&#8217;d have to add something to the
base class interface. So the dilemma is that you need to add methods to the base
class, but you can&#8217;t touch the base class. How do you get around this?</p>
<p>The design pattern that solves this kind of problem is called a &#8220;visitor&#8221; (the
final one in the <em>Design Patterns</em> book), and it builds on the double
dispatching scheme shown in the last section.</p>
<p>The visitor pattern allows you to extend the interface of the primary type by
creating a separate class hierarchy of type <strong>Visitor</strong> to virtualize the
operations performed upon the primary type. The objects of the primary type
simply &#8220;accept&#8221; the visitor, then call the visitor&#8217;s dynamically-bound method.
It looks like this:</p>
<img alt="_images/trashVisitor.gif" src="_images/trashVisitor.gif" />
<p>Now, if <strong>v</strong> is a <strong>Visitable</strong> reference to an <strong>Aluminum</strong> object, the code:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>PriceVisitor pv = PriceVisitor()
v.accept(pv)</pre>
</div>
<p>uses double dispatching to cause two polymorphic method calls: the first one to
select <strong>Aluminum</strong>&#8216;s version of <strong>accept( )</strong>, and the second one within
<strong>accept( )</strong> when the specific version of <strong>visit( )</strong> is called dynamically
using the base-class <strong>Visitor</strong> reference <strong>v</strong>.</p>
<p>This configuration means that new functionality can be added to the system in
the form of new subclasses of <strong>Visitor</strong>. The <strong>Trash</strong> hierarchy doesn&#8217;t need
to be touched. This is the prime benefit of the visitor pattern: you can add new
polymorphic functionality to a class hierarchy without touching that hierarchy
(once the <strong>accept( )</strong> methods have been installed). Note that the benefit is
helpful here but not exactly what we started out to accomplish, so at first
blush you might decide that this isn&#8217;t the desired solution.</p>
<p>But look at one thing that&#8217;s been accomplished: the visitor solution avoids
sorting from the master <strong>Trash</strong> sequence into individual typed sequences.
Thus, you can leave everything in the single master sequence and simply pass
through that sequence using the appropriate visitor to accomplish the goal.
Although this behavior seems to be a side effect of visitor, it does give us
what we want (avoiding RTTI).</p>
<p>The double dispatching in the visitor pattern takes care of determining both the
type of <strong>Trash</strong> and the type of <strong>Visitor</strong>. In the following example, there
are two implementations of <strong>Visitor</strong>: <strong>PriceVisitor</strong> to both determine and
sum the price, and <strong>WeightVisitor</strong> to keep track of the weights.</p>
<p>You can see all of this implemented in the new, improved version of the
recycling program.</p>
<p>As with <strong>DoubleDispatch.py</strong>, the <strong>Trash</strong> class is left alone and a new
interface is created to add the <strong>accept( )</strong> method:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre># PatternRefactoring/trashvisitor/Visitable.py
# An class to add visitor functionality
# to the Trash hierarchy without
# modifying the base class.

class Visitable:
    # The method:
    def accept(self, Visitor v)</pre>
</div>
<p>Since there&#8217;s nothing concrete in the <strong>Visitor</strong> base class, it can be created
as an <strong>interface</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre># PatternRefactoring/trashvisitor/Visitor.py
# The base class for visitors.

class Visitor:
    def visit(self, Aluminum a)
    def visit(self, Paper p)
    def visit(self, Glass g)
    def visit(self, Cardboard c)</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-reflective-decorator">
<h3>A Reflective Decorator<a class="headerlink" href="#a-reflective-decorator" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>At this point, you <em>could</em> follow the same approach that was used for double
dispatching and create new subtypes of <strong>Aluminum</strong>, <strong>Paper</strong>, <strong>Glass</strong>, and
<strong>Cardboard</strong> that implement the <strong>accept( )</strong> method. For example, the new
<strong>Visitable Aluminum</strong> would look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># PatternRefactoring/trashvisitor/VAluminum.py</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>However, we seem to be encountering an &#8220;explosion of interfaces:&#8221; basic
<strong>Trash</strong>, special versions for double dispatching, and now more special
versions for visitor. Of course, this &#8220;explosion of interfaces&#8221; is arbitrary-one
could simply put the additional methods in the <strong>Trash</strong> class. If we ignore
that we can instead see an opportunity to use the <em>Decorator</em> pattern: it seems
like it should be possible to create a <em>Decorator</em> that can be wrapped around an
ordinary <strong>Trash</strong> object and will produce the same interface as <strong>Trash</strong> and
add the extra <strong>accept( )</strong> method. In fact, it&#8217;s a perfect example of the value
of <em>Decorator</em>.</p>
<p>The double dispatch creates a problem, however. Since it relies on overloading
of both <strong>accept( )</strong> and <strong>visit( )</strong>, it would seem to require specialized
code for each different version of the <strong>accept( )</strong> method. With C++ templates,
this would be fairly easy to accomplish (since templates automatically generate
type-specialized code) but Python has no such mechanism-at least it does not
appear to. However, reflection allows you to determine type information at run
time, and it turns out to solve many problems that would seem to require
templates (albeit not as simply). Here&#8217;s the decorator that does the trick
<a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre># PatternRefactoring/trashvisitor/VisitableDecorator.py
# A decorator that adapts the generic Trash
# classes to the visitor pattern.

class VisitableDecorator(Trash, Visitable):
    def __init__(self, t):
        self.delegate = t
        try:
            self.dispatch = Visitor.class.getMethod (
              "visit", Class[]: t.getClass()
            )
        except ex:
            ex.printStackTrace()

    def getValue(self):
        return delegate.getValue()

    def getWeight(self):
        return delegate.getWeight()

    def accept(self, Visitor v):
        self.dispatch.invoke(v, delegate)</pre>
</div>
<p>[[ Description of Reflection use  ]]</p>
<p>The only other tool we need is a new type of <strong>Fillable</strong> adapter that
automatically decorates the objects as they are being created from the original
<strong>Trash.dat</strong> file. But this might as well be a decorator itself, decorating any
kind of <strong>Fillable</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># PatternRefactoring/trashvisitor/FillableVisitor.py</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now you can wrap it around any kind of existing <strong>Fillable</strong>, or any new ones
that haven&#8217;t yet been created.</p>
<p>The rest of the program creates specific <strong>Visitor</strong> types and sends them
through a single list of <strong>Trash</strong> objects:</p>

           ParseTrash.fillBin("../trash/Trash.dat",

           Iterator it = bin.iterator()
           while(it.hasNext()):
               Visitable v = (Visitable)it.next()
               v.accept(pv)
               v.accept(wv)

           pv.total()
           wv.total()

       def main(self, String args[]):
           TrashVisitor().test()

In **Test( )**, note how visitability is added by simply creating a different
kind of bin using the decorator. Also notice that the **FillableCollection**
adapter has the appearance of being used as a decorator (for **ArrayList**) in
this situation. However, it completely changes the interface of the
**ArrayList**, whereas the definition of *Decorator* is that the interface of
the decorated class must still be there after decoration.</pre>
</div>
<p>Note that the shape of the client code (shown in the <strong>Test</strong> class) has changed
again, from the original approaches to the problem. Now there&#8217;s only a single
<strong>Trash</strong> bin. The two <strong>Visitor</strong> objects are accepted into every element in
the sequence, and they perform their operations. The visitors keep their own
internal data to tally the total weights and prices.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s no run time type identification other than the inevitable cast
to <strong>Trash</strong> when pulling things out of the sequence. This, too, could be
eliminated with the implementation of parameterized types in Java.</p>
<p>One way you can distinguish this solution from the double dispatching solution
described previously is to note that, in the double dispatching solution, only
one of the overloaded methods, <strong>add( )</strong>, was overridden when each subclass was
created, while here <em>each</em> one of the overloaded <strong>visit( )</strong> methods is
overridden in every subclass of <strong>Visitor</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="more-coupling">
<h3>More Coupling?<a class="headerlink" href="#more-coupling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more code here, and there&#8217;s definite coupling between the
<strong>Trash</strong> hierarchy and the <strong>Visitor</strong> hierarchy. However, there&#8217;s also high
cohesion within the respective sets of classes: they each do only one thing
(<strong>Trash</strong> describes Trash, while <strong>Visitor</strong> describes actions performed on
<strong>Trash</strong>), which is an indicator of a good design. Of course, in this case it
works well only if you&#8217;re adding new <strong>Visitor</strong>s, but it gets in the way when
you add new types of <strong>Trash</strong>.</p>
<p>Low coupling between classes and high cohesion within a class is definitely an
important design goal. Applied mindlessly, though, it can prevent you from
achieving a more elegant design. It seems that some classes inevitably have a
certain intimacy with each other. These often occur in pairs that could perhaps
be called <em>couplets</em>; for example, containers and iterators. The <strong>Trash-
Visitor</strong> pair above appears to be another such couplet.</p>

<h2>RTTI Considered Harmful?<a class="headerlink" href="#rtti-considered-harmful" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Various designs in this chapter attempt to remove RTTI, which might give you the
impression that it&#8217;s &#8220;considered harmful&#8221; (the condemnation used for poor, ill-
fated <strong>goto</strong>, which was thus never put into Java). This isn&#8217;t true; it is the
<em>misuse</em> of RTTI that is the problem. The reason our designs removed RTTI is
because the misapplication of that feature prevented extensibility, while the
stated goal was to be able to add a new type to the system with as little impact
on surrounding code as possible. Since RTTI is often misused by having it look
for every single type in your system, it causes code to be non-extensible: when
you add a new type, you have to go hunting for all the code in which RTTI is
used, and if you miss any you won&#8217;t get help from the compiler.</p>
<p>However, RTTI doesn&#8217;t automatically create non-extensible code. Let&#8217;s revisit
the trash recycler once more. This time, a new tool will be introduced, which I
call a <strong>TypeMap</strong>. It contains a <strong>HashMap</strong> that holds <strong>ArrayList</strong>s, but
the interface is simple: you can <strong>add( )</strong> a new object, and you can <strong>get( )</strong>
an <strong>ArrayList</strong> containing all the objects of a particular type. The keys for
the contained <strong>HashMap</strong> are the types in the associated <strong>ArrayList</strong>. The
beauty of this design (suggested by Larry O&#8217;Brien) is that the <strong>TypeMap</strong>
dynamically adds a new pair whenever it encounters a new type, so whenever you
add a new type to the system (even if you add the new type at run time), it
adapts.</p>
<p>Our example will again build on the structure of the <strong>Trash</strong> types in
<strong>package patternRefactoring.Trash</strong> (and the <strong>Trash.dat</strong> file used there can
be used here without change):</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre># PatternRefactoring/dynatrash/DynaTrash.py
# Using a Map of Lists and RTTI
# to automatically sort trash into
# ArrayLists. This solution, despite the
# use of RTTI, is extensible.

# Generic TypeMap works in any situation:
class TypeMap:
    t = HashMap()
    def add(self, Object o):
        Class type = o.getClass()
        if(self.t.has_key(type))
            self.t.get(type).add(o)
        else:
            List v = ArrayList()
            v.add(o)
            t.put(type,v)

    def get(self, Class type):
        return (List)t.get(type)

    def keys(self):
        return t.keySet().iterator()

# Adapter class to allow callbacks
# from ParseTrash.fillBin():
class TypeMapAdapter(Fillable):
    TypeMap map
    def __init__(self, TypeMap tm): map = tm
    def addTrash(self, Trash t): map.add(t)

class DynaTrash(UnitTest):
    TypeMap bin = TypeMap()
    def __init__(self):
        ParseTrash.fillBin("../trash/Trash.dat",
          TypeMapAdapter(bin))

    def test(self):
        Iterator keys = bin.keys()
        while(keys.hasNext())
            Trash.sumValue(
              bin.get((Class)keys.next()).iterator())

    def main(self, String args[]):
        DynaTrash().test()</pre>
</div>
<p>Although powerful, the definition for <strong>TypeMap</strong> is simple. It contains a
<strong>HashMap</strong>, and the <strong>add( )</strong> method does most of the work. When you <strong>add(
)</strong> a new object, the reference for the <strong>Class</strong> object for that type is
extracted. This is used as a key to determine whether an <strong>ArrayList</strong> holding
objects of that type is already present in the <strong>HashMap</strong>. If so, that
<strong>ArrayList</strong> is extracted and the object is added to the <strong>ArrayList</strong>. If not,
the <strong>Class</strong> object and a new <strong>ArrayList</strong> are added as a key-value pair.</p>
<p>You can get an <strong>Iterator</strong> of all the <strong>Class</strong> objects from <strong>keys( )</strong>, and
use each <strong>Class</strong> object to fetch the corresponding <strong>ArrayList</strong> with <strong>get(
)</strong>. And that&#8217;s all there is to it.</p>
<p>The <strong>filler( )</strong> method is interesting because it takes advantage of the design
of <strong>ParseTrash.fillBin( )</strong>, which doesn&#8217;t just try to fill an <strong>ArrayList</strong>
but instead anything that implements the <strong>Fillable</strong> interface with its
<strong>addTrash( )</strong> method. All <strong>filler( )</strong> needs to do is to return a reference
to an <strong>interface</strong> that implements <strong>Fillable</strong>, and then this reference can be
used as an argument to <strong>fillBin( )</strong> like this:</p>
<p>ParseTrash.fillBin(&#8220;Trash.dat&#8221;, bin.filler())</p>
<p>To produce this reference, an <em>anonymous inner class</em> (described in <em>Thinking in
Java</em>) is used. You never need a named class to implement <strong>Fillable</strong>, you just
need a reference to an object of that class, thus this is an appropriate use of
anonymous inner classes.</p>
<p>An interesting thing about this design is that even though it wasn&#8217;t created to
handle the sorting, <strong>fillBin( )</strong> is performing a sort every time it inserts a
<strong>Trash</strong> object into <strong>bin</strong>.</p>
<p>Much of <strong>class DynaTrash</strong> should be familiar from the previous examples. This
time, instead of placing the new <strong>Trash</strong> objects into a <strong>bin</strong> of type
<strong>ArrayList</strong>, the <strong>bin</strong> is of type <strong>TypeMap</strong>, so when the trash is thrown
into <strong>bin</strong> it&#8217;s immediately sorted by <strong>TypeMap</strong>&#8216;s internal sorting
mechanism. Stepping through the <strong>TypeMap</strong> and operating on each individual
<strong>ArrayList</strong> becomes a simple matter.</p>
<p>As you can see, adding a new type to the system won&#8217;t affect this code at all,
and the code in <strong>TypeMap</strong> is completely independent. This is certainly the
smallest solution to the problem, and arguably the most elegant as well. It does
rely heavily on RTTI, but notice that each key-value pair in the <strong>HashMap</strong> is
looking for only one type. In addition, there&#8217;s no way you can &#8220;forget&#8221; to add
the proper code to this system when you add a new type, since there isn&#8217;t any
code you need to add.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Coming up with a design such as <strong>TrashVisitor.py</strong> that contains a larger
amount of code than the earlier designs can seem at first to be
counterproductive. It pays to notice what you&#8217;re trying to accomplish with
various designs. Design patterns in general strive to <em>separate the things that
change from the things that stay the same</em>. The &#8220;things that change&#8221; can refer
to many different kinds of changes. Perhaps the change occurs because the
program is placed into a new environment or because something in the current
environment changes (this could be: &#8220;The user wants to add a new shape to the
diagram currently on the screen&#8221;). Or, as in this case, the change could be the
evolution of the code body. While previous versions of the trash sorting example
emphasized the addition of new <em>types</em> of <strong>Trash</strong> to the system,
<strong>TrashVisitor.py</strong> allows you to easily add new <em>functionality</em> without
disturbing the <strong>Trash</strong> hierarchy. There&#8217;s more code in <strong>TrashVisitor.py</strong>,
but adding new functionality to <strong>Visitor</strong> is cheap. If this is something that
happens a lot, then it&#8217;s worth the extra effort and code to make it happen more
easily.</p>
<p>The discovery of the vector of change is no trivial matter; it&#8217;s not something
that an analyst can usually detect before the program sees its initial design.
The necessary information will probably not appear until later phases in the
project: sometimes only at the design or implementation phases do you discover a
deeper or more subtle need in your system. In the case of adding new types
(which was the focus of most of the &#8220;recycle&#8221; examples) you might realize that
you need a particular inheritance hierarchy only when you are in the maintenance
phase and you begin extending the system!</p>
<p>One of the most important things that you&#8217;ll learn by studying design patterns
seems to be an about-face from what has been promoted so far in this book. That
is: &#8220;OOP is all about polymorphism.&#8221; This statement can produce the &#8220;two-year-
old with a hammer&#8221; syndrome (everything looks like a nail). Put another way,
it&#8217;s hard enough to &#8220;get&#8221; polymorphism, and once you do, you try to cast all
your designs into that one particular mold.</p>
<p>What design patterns say is that OOP isn&#8217;t just about polymorphism. It&#8217;s about
&#8220;separating the things that change from the things that stay the same.&#8221;
Polymorphism is an especially important way to do this, and it turns out to be
helpful if the programming language directly supports polymorphism (so you don&#8217;t
have to wire it in yourself, which would tend to make it prohibitively
expensive). But design patterns in general show <em>other</em> ways to accomplish the
basic goal, and once your eyes have been opened to this you will begin to search
for more creative designs.</p>
<p>Since the <em>Design Patterns</em> book came out and made such an impact, people have
been searching for other patterns. You can expect to see more of these appear as
time goes on. Here are some sites recommended by Jim Coplien, of C++ fame
(<em>http://www.bell-labs.com/~cope</em>), who is one of the main proponents of the
patterns movement:</p>
