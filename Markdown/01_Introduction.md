Introduction
============

> The vision for this book.

This is a collection of essays that give you a deeper understanding of
programming in Python. Although the first chapter in the book is [Python for
Programmers], this is not intended to be an introductory Python book (there
are plenty of excellent Python tutorials and online learning resources). The
remaining chapters assume you have an adequate grasp of the language and can
follow along---this might require that you study other resources if there are
language features you don't understand.

You can think of this as an "intermediate" or "somewhat advanced" book, but
the "somewhat" modifier is important. Because it is not introductory, two
difficult constraints are removed.

1.  In an introductory book you are forced to describe everything in
    lock step, never mentioning anything before it has been thoroughly
    introduced.

2.  In this book topics are chosen based on whether they are interesting
    and/or useful, not on whether they are introductory or not.

Contributors
------------

When someone has done the majority of the work on a chapter (and I've only
edited), their name is shown as the author at the beginning of that chapter.

something unless you are sure this is the case (read your company's
employment contract---these often specify that anything you think of or

The Printed Book
----------------

Because of the creative commons license, the electronic version of the
book as well as all the sources are available, can be reproduced on
other web sites, etc. (again, as long as you attribute it).

You can print your own version of the book. I will be creating a printed
version of the book for sale, with a nice cover and binding. Many people
do like to have a print version of the book, and part of the motivation
for doing a print version is to make some income off the effort I put
into the book.

But buying my particular print version of the book is optional. All of
the tools will be downloadable so that you can print it yourself, or
send it to a copy shop and have it bound, etc. The only thing you won't
get is my cover and binding.

Translations
------------

Launchpad.net, where this project is hosted, has support for doing
translations and this gave me an idea. I had just come back from
speaking at the Python conference in Brazil, and was thinking about the
user group there and how I might support them. (We had done a seminar
while I was there in order to help pay for my trip and support the
organization).

If the book can be kept in a Sphinx restructured text format that can be
turned directly into camera-ready PDF (the basic form is there but it
will take somebody messing about with it to get it into camera-ready
layout), then the job of translation can be kept to something that could
be done by user groups during sprints. The user group could then use a
print-on-demand service to print the book, and get the group members to
take them to local bookstores and do other kinds of promotions. The
profits from the book could go to the user group (who knows, just like
the Brazillian group, your group may end up using some of those profits
to bring me to speak at your conference!).

If possible, I would like a royalty from these translations. To me, 5%
of the cover price sounds reasonable. If the user group would like to
use my cover, then they could pay this royalty. If they wanted to go
their own way, it's creative commons so as long as the book is
attributed that's their choice.

My Motives
----------

Just so it's clear, I have the following motives for creating this book:

1.  Learn more about Python and contribute to the Python community, to
    help create more and better Python programmers.
2.  Develop more Python consulting and training clients through the
    publicity generated by the book (see [here](https://www.mindviewllc.com/)).
3.  Experiment with group creation of teaching materials for the book,
    which will benefit me in my own training (see the previous point)
    but will also benefit anyone choosing to use the book as a text in a
    course or training seminar. (See TeachingSupport).
4.  Generate profits by selling printed books. (But see above about the
    ability to print the book yourself).
5.  Help raise money for non-U.S. Python user groups via translations,
    from which I might gain a small percentage.


Contributions
-------------

This book is hosted on Github and we use the tools there to support
contributions. You can either open an issue or make a pull request.

What can you contribute? Anything as small as spelling and grammatical
corrections, and as large as a whole chapter. Research into new topics
and creating examples is what takes me the most time, so if you know
something already or are willing to figure it out, don't worry if your
writing or programming isn't perfect---contribute it and I and the rest
of the group will improve it.
