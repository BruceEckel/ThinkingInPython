Visitor
********************************************************************************

The visitor pattern is implemented using multiple dispatching, but people often
confuse the two, because they look at the implementation rather than the intent.

The assumption is that you have a primary class hierarchy that is fixed; perhaps
it's from another vendor and you can't make changes to that hierarchy. However,
your intent is that you'd like to add new polymorphic methods to that hierarchy,
which means that normally you'd have to add something to the base class
interface. So the dilemma is that you need to add methods to the base class, but
you can't touch the base class. How do you get around this?

The design pattern that solves this kind of problem is called a "visitor" (the
final one in the *Design Patterns* book), and it builds on the double
dispatching scheme shown in the last section.

The visitor pattern allows you to extend the interface of the primary type by
creating a separate class hierarchy of type **Visitor** to virtualize the
operations performed upon the primary type. The objects of the primary type
simply "accept" the visitor, then call the visitor's dynamically-bound member
function::

    # Visitor/FlowerVisitors.py
    # Demonstration of "visitor" pattern.
    from __future__ import generators
    import random

    # The Flower hierarchy cannot be changed:
    class Flower(object):
        def accept(self, visitor):
            visitor.visit(self)
        def pollinate(self, pollinator):
            print(self, "pollinated by", pollinator)
        def eat(self, eater):
            print(self, "eaten by", eater)
        def __str__(self):
            return self.__class__.__name__

    class Gladiolus(Flower): pass
    class Runuculus(Flower): pass
    class Chrysanthemum(Flower): pass

    class Visitor:
        def __str__(self):
            return self.__class__.__name__

    class Bug(Visitor): pass
    class Pollinator(Bug): pass
    class Predator(Bug): pass

    # Add the ability to do "Bee" activities:
    class Bee(Pollinator):
        def visit(self, flower):
            flower.pollinate(self)

    # Add the ability to do "Fly" activities:
    class Fly(Pollinator):
        def visit(self, flower):
            flower.pollinate(self)

    # Add the ability to do "Worm" activities:
    class Worm(Predator):
        def visit(self, flower):
            flower.eat(self)

    def flowerGen(n):
        flwrs = Flower.__subclasses__()
        for i in range(n):
            yield random.choice(flwrs)()

    # It's almost as if I had a method to Perform
    # various "Bug" operations on all Flowers:
    bee = Bee()
    fly = Fly()
    worm = Worm()
    for flower in flowerGen(10):
        flower.accept(bee)
        flower.accept(fly)
        flower.accept(worm)




Exercises
=======================================================================

#.  Create a business-modeling environment with three types of **Inhabitant**:
    **Dwarf** (for engineers), **Elf** (for marketers) and **Troll** (for
    managers). Now create a class called **Project** that creates the different
    inhabitants and causes them to **interact( )** with each other using
    multiple dispatching.

#.  Modify the above example to make the interactions more detailed. Each
    **Inhabitant** can randomly produce a **Weapon** using **getWeapon( )**: a
    **Dwarf** uses **Jargon** or **Play**, an **Elf** uses **InventFeature** or
    **SellImaginaryProduct**, and a **Troll** uses **Edict** and **Schedule**.
    You must decide which weapons "win" and "lose" in each interaction (as in
    **PaperScissorsRock.py**). Add a **battle( )** member function to
    **Project** that takes two **Inhabitant**\s and matches them against each
    other. Now create a **meeting( )** member function for **Project** that
    creates groups of **Dwarf**, **Elf** and **Troll** and battles the groups
    against each other until only members of one group are left standing. These
    are the "winners."

#.  Modify **PaperScissorsRock.py** to replace the double dispatching with a
    table lookup. The easiest way to do this is to create a **Map** of
    **Map**\s, with the key of each **Map** the class of each object. Then you
    can do the lookup by saying:
    `((Map)map.get(o1.getClass())).get(o2.getClass())` Notice how much easier it
    is to reconfigure the system. When is it more appropriate to use this
    approach vs. hard-coding the dynamic dispatches? Can you create a system
    that has the syntactic simplicity of use of the dynamic dispatch but uses a
    table lookup?

#.  Modify Exercise 2 to use the table lookup technique described in Exercise 3.
